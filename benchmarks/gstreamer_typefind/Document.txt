 * GstState:

 * @GST_STATE_NULL        : the NULL state or initial state of an element.
 * @GST_STATE_READY       : the element is ready to go to PAUSED.
 * @GST_STATE_PAUSED      : the element is PAUSED, it is ready to accept and
 *                          process data. Sink elements however only accept one

 * @GST_STATE_PLAYING     : the element is PLAYING, the #GstClock is running and
 *                          the data is flowing.
 *
 * The possible states an element can be in. States can be changed using
 * gst_element_set_state() and checked using gst_element_get_state().
